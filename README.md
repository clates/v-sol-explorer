# Virginia SOL Explorer

[Live Version](https://clates.github.io/v-sol-explorer/)

Virginia SOL Explorer is a comprehensive tool designed to help homeschool parents and educators track student progress through the Virginia Standards of Learning (SOLs). This application provides an intuitive interface for navigating, understanding, and documenting mastery of educational standards across multiple subjects and grade levels.

## Purpose

Created specifically for homeschool families and educators in Virginia, this tool helps you:

* **Track learning progress** with a simple three-state mastery system (Completed, Needs Work, Not Started).
* **Manage multiple student profiles** to monitor each child's individual progress.
* **Share progress data** between parents/teachers through the import/export feature.
* **Focus your teaching efforts** by identifying standards that need additional attention.
* **No account registration or cloud storage required** - all data is stored locally on your device with options to export for backup or sharing between devices.
* **Gentle first-time tour** explains how everything works and can be reopened from the settings gear.
* **Efficient scrolling** through large standard lists thanks to virtualization.

## Why Use Virginia SOL Explorer?
